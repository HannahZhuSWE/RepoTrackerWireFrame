# Repo Tracker Mockup 
Basic idea of the frontend for Repo Tracker. Purpose is to understand how the webpage will look and how components will interact with each other. Currently not connected to the Repo Tracker tool or Kusto. 

Will eventually be able to connect to Kusto and Repo Tracker to display the metadata of articles and repos given their url.

To run first clone this repo, run npm install then run npm start.
